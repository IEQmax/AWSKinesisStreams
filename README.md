# AWSKinesisStreams

This library lets your agent code to work with [Amazon Kinesis Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/). It makes use of the [Amazon Kinesis Streams REST API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/).

This version of the library supports the following functionality:

- writing data records into an Amazon Kinesis stream
- getting data records from an Amazon Kinesis stream's shard

**To add this library to your project, add** `#require "AWSKinesisStreams.agent.lib.nut:1.0.0"` **to the top of your agent code.**

## Prerequisites

Before using the library you need to have:

- *region* &mdash; **TBD**
- *accessKeyId* &mdash; **TBD**
- *secretAccessKey* &mdash; **TBD**

Also, you need to understand all the main Amazon Kinesis Streams concepts and terms, like stream, shard, record, etc.

## Library Usage

The library consists of two main and independent parts &mdash; [Data Writing](#data-wariting) and [Data Getting](#data-getting). You can instantiate and use any of these parts in your agent code as required by your application. Also, the library includes [Common Components](#common-components) which are used by the both main parts.

### Common Components

#### Callbacks

All requests that are made to the Amazon Kinesis Streams library occur asynchronously. Every method that sends a request has an optional parameter which takes a callback function that will be called when the operation is completed, successfully or not. The callbacksâ€™ parameters are listed in the corresponding method documentation, but every callback has at least one parameter, *error*. If *error* is `null`, the operation has been executed successfully. Otherwise, *error* is an instance of the [AWSKinesisStreams.Error](#awskinesisstreamserror-class) class and contains the details of the error.

#### AWSKinesisStreams.Error Class

Represents an error returned by the library and has the following public properties:

- *type* &mdash; The error type, which is one of the following *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ERROR* enum values:

  - *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ERROR.LIBRARY_ERROR* &mdash; The library is wrongly initialized, or a method is called with invalid argument(s), or an internal error. The error details can be found in the *details* property. Usually it indicates an issue during an application development which should be fixed during debugging and therefore should not occur after the application has been deployed.
  
  - *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ERROR.REQUEST_FAILED* &mdash; HTTP request to Amazon Kinesis Streams fails. The error details can be found in the *details*, *httpStatus* and *httpResponse* properties. This error may occur during the normal execution of an application. The application logic should process this error.
  
  - *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ERROR.UNEXPECTED_RESPONSE* &mdash; An unexpected response from Amazon Kinesis Streams. The error details can be found in the *details* and *httpResponse* properties.
  
- *details* &mdash; A string with human readable details of the error.

- *httpStatus* &mdash; An integer indicating the HTTP status code, or `null` if *type* is *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ERROR.LIBRARY_ERROR*

- *httpResponse* &mdash; A table of key-value strings holding the response body of the failed request, or `null` if *type* is *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ERROR.LIBRARY_ERROR*.

#### AWSKinesisStreams Class

##### setDebug(*value*)

This method enables (*value* = `true`) or disables (*value* = `false`) the library debug output (including error logging). It is disabled by default. The method returns nothing.

#### AWSKinesisStreams.Record Class

Represents an Amazon Kinesis Streams record: a combination of data attributes. It has the following public properties:

- *data* &mdash; The record data (blob or any JSON-compatible type).
- *partitionKey* &mdash; Identifies which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_Record.html#Streams-Type-Record-PartitionKey).
- *sequenceNumber* &mdash; The unique identifier of the record within its shard. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_Record.html#Streams-Type-Record-SequenceNumber).
- *timestamp* &mdash; The approximate time that the record was inserted into the stream. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_Record.html#Streams-Type-Record-ApproximateArrivalTimestamp).
- *encryptionType* &mdash; The encryption type used on the record. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_Record.html#Streams-Type-Record-EncryptionType). This property can be one of the following values:
  - *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ENCRYPTION_TYPE.NONE* &mdash; Record is not encrypted.
  - *AWS_KINESIS_STREAMS_ENCRYPTION_TYPE.KMS* &mdash; Record is encrypted on server side using a customer-managed KMS key.

##### Constructor: AWSKinesisStreams.Record(*data, partitionKey[, explicitHashKey][, prevSequenceNumber]*)

Creates and returns AWSKinesisStreams.Record object that can be written into an Amazon Kinesis stream using [AWSKinesisStreams.Producer](#awskinesisstreamsproducer-class) methods.

| Parameter | Data Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *data* | blob or any JSON-compatible type | Yes | The record data |
| *partitionKey* | string | Yes | Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html#Streams-PutRecord-request-PartitionKey) |
| *explicitHashKey* | string | Optional | The hash value used to explicitly determine the shard the data record is assigned to by overriding the partition key hash. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html#Streams-PutRecord-request-ExplicitHashKey) |
| *prevSequenceNumber* | string | Optional | Guarantees strictly increasing sequence numbers, for puts from the same client and to the same partition key. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html#Streams-PutRecord-request-SequenceNumberForOrdering) |

### Data Writing

#### AWSKinesisStreams.Producer Class

*streamName* - a name of Amazon Kinesis stream - unique across all streams in one AWS account in one region

#### AWSKinesisStreams.PutRecordResult Class

### Data Getting

#### AWSKinesisStreams.Consumer Class
